### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**pjyi/pjyi** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


- I'm a computational linguist specializing in NLP, text analytics, and spoken language processing. I embrace the diversity of natural languages and enjoy collaborating with researchers from various research and linguistic backgrounds. I'm passionate about incorporating linguistic insights into building chatbots, speech synthesis, ASR, and ML-based NLP.


- ğŸ’¬ Prior to joining the tech-y community, I went through a rigorous training in theoretical and applied linguistics where I've developed interest in the area of phonetics and phonology. I hope to keep learning to draw on an array of methods from computational linguistics (NLP and ML in particular) to expound linguistic phenomena and apply findings from linguistics to develop improved techniques for automated computational understanding of natural language.  More specifically, I aspire to become a NLP engineer, working in speech recognition where I help train machines to better parse and 
generate linguistic information beyond the surface segmental level by tapping into suprasegmental prosodic information, including but not limited to variations on pitch, intonation, stress patterns, loudness, and rhythm.
